# Data Preparation Lab

Data preparation is a crucial step in every data-driven project. In this lab, we focus on exploring, visualizing, and transforming the dataset to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.

## Objectives

1. **Explore and Visualize the Dataset:**
   - Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
   - Identify possible anomalies and patterns.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation Techniques:**
   - Treat missing values, if any.
   - Address outliers and apply necessary fixes.
   - Transform categorical features if required.
   - Enhance distribution properties of numerical features.
   - Apply feature engineering techniques.
